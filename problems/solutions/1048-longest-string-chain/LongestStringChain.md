# 1048. Longest String Chain

Reference: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-string-chain

## Description
```
You are given an array of words where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

wordA is a predecessor of wordB if and only if we can insert exactly one letter anywhere in wordA without changing the order of the other characters to make it equal to wordB.

For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac", while "cba" is not a predecessor of "bcad".
A word chain is a sequence of words [word1, word2, ..., wordk] with k >= 1, where word1 is a predecessor of word2, word2 is a predecessor of word3, and so on. A single word is trivially a word chain with k == 1.

Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.

Example 1:

Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: One of the longest word chains is ["a","ba","bda","bdca"].
Example 2:

Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]
Output: 5
Explanation: All the words can be put in a word chain ["xb", "xbc", "cxbc", "pcxbc", "pcxbcf"].
Example 3:

Input: words = ["abcd","dbqca"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The trivial word chain ["abcd"] is one of the longest word chains.
["abcd","dbqca"] is not a valid word chain because the ordering of the letters is changed.
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 1000
1 <= words[i].length <= 16
words[i] only consists of lowercase English letters.
```

## Solution

Immediately though of using a map for keeping track of the max chain length. However, I had to look at the top discussions on the problem, to come up with an effective way to use this data structure.
```
class Solution {
public:
    static bool compare(const string &s1, const string &s2) {
        return s1.length() < s2.length();
    }

    int longestStrChain(vector<string>& words) {
        sort(words.begin(), words.end(), compare);
        unordered_map<string, int> dp;
        int res = 0;
        for (string w: words) {
            for (int i = 0; i < w.length(); i++) {
                string pre = w.substr(0,i) + w.substr(i+1);
                dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp.find(pre) == dp.end() ? 1 : dp[pre] + 1);
            }
            res = max(res, dp[w]);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## Main Points
- I needed to figure out how to effectively use the data structure chosen
- Dynamic programming still seems a little fuzzy to my understanding
